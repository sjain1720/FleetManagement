# FleetManagement
The Fleet Management System provides real-time statistics on critical (e.g., low battery, offline) and non-critical (e.g., insurance renewal) alerts. It lists all alerts with their current status, whether active or resolved, ensuring effective monitoring and prompt action on fleet issues.
